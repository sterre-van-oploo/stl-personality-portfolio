    <!-- <h3 class="ab-me-text">Hi my name is Sterre, I am 16 years old and I am going to tell you some <br> stuff about my love for coding and this
        project, here it goes!  
        <br> <br> 
        My code journey began 2 years <br> ago, a few months before april. 
        After my interest for nerdy things like <br> building my own pc and keeping watch over the stats grew, 
        my uncle <br> introduced me to coding in the form of right click, inspect element. 
        I was <br> flabbergasted and I messed around with that for a week or so until he said <br> to me that I can 
        make that myself. So he downloaded VScode for me and I went <br> straight to work. First I pasted a file 
        from magister so I could make <br> changes that actually stayed. Then I made my very first project. 
        I messed <br> around with that some more before I went on an internship at my uncles. 
        I <br> learned so much in those two weeks. My interest in coding only grew. Fast <br> forward a year or so. 
        I spent my time doing it as a hobby during the breaks <br> or after school. 
        Then another opportunity for an internship at my uncles, <br> cool! I really wanted to challenge myself. 
        I designed and made another big <br> website in two weeks. 
        And ever since I’ve known that I would want to do <br> something with it. 
        And now I am here and I can't wait to learn more! In this <br> website I show you some of my hobbies, projects 
        and interests. On this page <br> I have a little slideshow with some pictures I took. Below are two of my <br> main 
        projects! I’ve also made a digital sketchbook with drawings, animations <br> and other little projects. And I have 
        a picture of my guitar because it is <br> one of my prized possessions (and I wanted to show off how cool it is :D)
